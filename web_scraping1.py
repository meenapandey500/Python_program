We wonâ€™t fully dive into status codes here, but a status code starting with a 2

'''We can now print out the HTML content of the page, formatted nicely,
using the prettify method on the BeautifulSoup object:'''

print(soup.find_all('p')) #FIND ALL <P> OF HTML FILE and hold in list

print(soup.find_all('p')[0].get_text()) #to print only data of 0th index from list
